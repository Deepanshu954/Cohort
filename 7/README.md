# Project 7

This project contains authentication and database logic for a Node.js application. The main files are:

- `auth.js`: Handles authentication logic (e.g., JWT verification).
- `db.js`: Handles database connection and queries.
- `index.js`: Main entry point for the application.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the application:
   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

## Project Structure
- `auth.js`: Authentication middleware and helpers.
- `db.js`: Database connection and helper functions.
- `index.js`: Main server logic.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Notes
- Ensure you have a valid database connection string in your environment variables if required.
- Update JWT secret and other sensitive information as needed.
