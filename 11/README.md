# Week 11 ‚Äì Recoil State Management in React

This folder demonstrates the use of Recoil for state management in React applications. Recoil provides a simple and flexible way to manage global state, selectors, and derived data, making it easier to build scalable React apps.

## üß† What I Learned
- Using Recoil atoms for global state
- Creating selectors for derived/computed state
- Integrating Recoil with React components
- Advantages of Recoil over prop drilling and Context API for complex state

## Features
- Global counter state using Recoil atom
- Selector to compute if the counter is even
- Simple, reactive UI updates based on state changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- React 19+
- Recoil
- Vite
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## Notes
- Recoil makes global state management in React more intuitive and less verbose than Context API for many use cases.
- Selectors allow for efficient derived state without unnecessary re-renders.
- This folder is a practical introduction to Recoil's core concepts.
